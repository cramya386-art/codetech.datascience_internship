📁 Project README
🚀 Overview
This repository contains a series of hands-on data science and machine learning tasks implemented using Python. Each task demonstrates a critical component of business analytics, AI model development, and deployment—perfectly aligned with real-world applications.

📦 Tasks Breakdown
1️⃣ Optimization Model (Linear Programming)
- Goal: Maximize profit from producing resin crafts and silk thread earrings.
- Tools Used: PuLP
- Deliverable: Jupyter notebook modeling constraints (materials, budget, time) and calculating optimal product quantities.
- Highlights:
- Decision variable setup
- Objective function for profit maximization
- Material, time, and budget constraints
- Solution output and business insights
2️⃣ End-to-End Data Science Pipeline + API Deployment
- Goal: Train a machine learning model and expose it as an API.
- Tools Used: pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, Flask
- Deliverables:
- train_model.py: Loads dataset, preprocesses features, trains a model, saves it
- app.py: A Flask app exposing a /predict endpoint for real-time predictions
- Usage:
- Train the model and launch the app with python app.py
- Send POST requests with input features to get predictions
3️⃣ Deep Learning Project (Image Classification)
- Goal: Build and visualize a deep learning model for clothing image classification.
- Tools Used: TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib
- Dataset: Fashion MNIST (preloaded via TensorFlow)
- Deliverables: A single Python snippet that:
- Preprocesses and normalizes image data
- Builds and trains a neural network
- Visualizes accuracy/loss across epochs
- Predicts and displays sample outputs
4️⃣ ETL Pipeline (Data Pipeline Development)
- Goal: Automate preprocessing and transformation using Scikit-Learn pipelines.
- Tools Used: pandas, scikit-learn, joblib
- Deliverable: Python script to:
- Handle missing data and data types
- Encode categorical features and scale numerics
- Save transformed datasets and preprocessing pipeline
- Files Produced:
- X_train_processed.csv, X_test_processed.csv
- etl_pipeline.pkl for future reuse
